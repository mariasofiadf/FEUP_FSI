    How is CVE-2020-5902 exploited and what is the risk?

The Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI), also known as the Configuration utility, used to manage F5 servers has a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. This vulnerability allows for unauthenticated attackers with network access to the vulnerable F5 server to execute arbitrary system commands, create or delete files, disable services, and/or execute arbitrary Java code.

Further exploitation of this vulnerability can allow threat actors to gain a foothold inside the targeted networks and conduct malicious activity, such as spreading ransomware. Proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrating the exploit has been published publicly to GitHub, Twitter, and other platforms.
